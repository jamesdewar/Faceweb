# Faceweb

This is my final year project of live facial recognition in the Browser using Deep Learning. 

this project is unfinished (maybe 80% done) and still buggy.

I would like to thank Brandon Amos at CMU for his help and his Openface project. His work on Openface is used in my work
and either is or will be referenced properly.
