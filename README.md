# Faceweb

This is my final year project of live facial recognition in the Browser using Deep Learning. 

It uses Nodejs with ExpressJs to manage the HTTPS requests and uses a TCP connection to run a Python subprocess (where tha actual ML is happening).
 
this project is unfinished (maybe 80% done) and still buggy.

I would like to thank Brandon Amos at CMU for his help and his Openface project. His work on Openface is used in my work and either is or will be referenced properly, when this project is completed.
